Problem Statement

Creating a power dialer here.
The users are agents for which the system dials from a pool of leads.
Given that a subset of the outbound dials fails (e.g voicemail, no answer etc.),
we set the DIAL_RATIO=2; i.e for each agent, dial 2 leads at any point in time.
This increases the Agent Utilization (% of time the agent is on a call)
while maintaining a small Abandon Rate (% calls abandoned because no agent was
available to take it)

What do I need ?

1. Download sqllite4java-282.zip from https://bitbucket.org/almworks/sqlite4java/downloads/
and place it in your java classpath (/Library/Java/Extensions/ on OSX). This is needed
to estabish a local instance of DynamoDB table used for running unit tests.

2. An IDE to run the java project. Import it as a maven project.
